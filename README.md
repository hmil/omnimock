# TypeScript - EasyMock

Delightful unit test mocking for TypeScript, inspired by [EasyMock](http://easymock.org).

## Goal

This project aims to stay as close as possible to the original EasyMock API. It is essentially a port of the original Java project.

## Project status

This is currently just a quick and dirty PoC.
